## Groups

When support requests arrive in Zendesk, they can be assigned to a Group.  Groups serve as the core element of ticket workflow; support agents are organized into Groups and tickets can be assigned to a Group only, or to an assigned agent within a Group.  A ticket can never be assigned to an agent without also being assigned to a Group.
