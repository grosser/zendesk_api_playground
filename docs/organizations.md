## Organizations

Just as agents can be segmented into Groups in Zendesk, your customers (end-users) can be segmented into Organizations.  You can manually assign customers to an Organization or automatically assign them to an Organization by their email address domain.  Organizations can be used in business rules to route Tickets to Groups of agents or send special email notifications.
